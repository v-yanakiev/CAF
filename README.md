# Chores and Fulfillment
A Freelance Platform for Chores and Small Tasks

## What is CAF?
Chores and Fulfillment is a website modelled on already existing
freelance websites, such as Upwork, with one exception -
Chores and Fulfillment is focused on solving jobs within the physical world.

## What tasks can this service fulfill?
Every registered user can "announce" pretty much
any legal task they want to be fulfilled,
including cleaning, washing, walking the dog, and so on.

## How does it all work?
After a task has been "announced",
and registered within our system,
anyone can submit an application to fulfill the task.
The task-filer looks at all the applicants, and picks the one
they think is best qualified. It's that simple!

## How is task-completion verified?
Every registered user with an Employer Account can "announce" pretty much
any legal task they want to be fulfilled,
including cleaning, washing, walking the dog, and so on.
